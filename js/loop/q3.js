/*
Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.

Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

for - loops through a block of code a number of times

while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

*/
// for loop
for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
    const element = array[index];
    
}
// while
while (condition) {
    
}
// do while
do {
    
} while (condition);

// for each
array.forEach(element => {
    
});
